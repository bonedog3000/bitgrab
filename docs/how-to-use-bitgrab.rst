How to use ``bitgrab``
======================

In the code example below, we demonstrate the basic usage of ``bitgrab``: the

use to copy the contents into a new directory. You can also find the same code
in the file `examples/basic_usage.py` of the repository.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/basic_usage.py
